# Titanic Data Analysis - ML Preparation

This project includes two essential tasks to prepare and analyze the Titanic dataset for machine learning:

## 🧹 Task 1: Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

**Objective:** Prepare raw Titanic data for machine learning models.

**Steps Covered:**
- Load and explore dataset structure
- Handle missing values (mean/median/mode)
- Encode categorical features (One-Hot Encoding)
- Normalize/standardize numerical features (Age, Fare)
- Detect and remove outliers using boxplots and IQR

**Tools Used:**  
`Pandas`, `NumPy`, `Seaborn`, `Matplotlib`, `Sklearn`

## 📊 Task 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

**Objective:** Understand the Titanic data using statistics and visualizations.

**Steps Covered:**
- Generate descriptive statistics (mean, median, std)
- Create histograms and boxplots for numeric features
- Use correlation matrices and pairplots for relationships
- Identify patterns, trends, and outliers
- Draw insights from visuals (e.g., survival vs. gender)

**Tools Used:**  
`Pandas`, `Matplotlib`, `Seaborn`, `Plotly`
